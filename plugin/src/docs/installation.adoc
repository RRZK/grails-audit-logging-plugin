== Installation
=== Dependencies
Add to your build.gradle project dependencies block:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   compile 'org.grails.plugins:audit-logging:{version}'
}
----
Then run the following to refresh gradle dependencies: 

[source,gradle]
----
gradle classes
----

NOTE: After installing the plugin, you must perform the following command to let the plugin create the audit-logging domain class within your project.

=== Create Audit Domain Artifact

    grails audit-quickstart <your.package.name> <YourAuditLogEventClassName>

For example:

    grails audit-quickstart org.myaudit.example AuditTrail

This will create the Audit Domain class as well as configure:

    grails.plugin.auditLog.auditDomainClassName = 'org.myaudit.example.AuditTrail'
    
Once created, you should open the generated file to adjust the `mappings` and `constraints` to suit your needs.

WARNING: Be sure to respect the existing nullability constraints or the plugin may not work correctly
