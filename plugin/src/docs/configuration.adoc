== Configuration

The plugin configuration can be specified in the application.groovy file.
It supports Environments blocks for environment-specific configuration.

[WARNING]
====
Since version 2.0.0, the configuration key has changed from "auditLog" to "grails.plugins.auditLog".
If you use the old configuration key, the plugin will log a notice.
====

[cols="30,30,40"]
|====================
| *Property* | *Default Value* | *Meaning*

|grails.plugin.auditLog.auditDomainClassName
|use "grails audit-quickstart" to create one
|Mandatory Domain Class Name for the AuditTrail Domain class. Mandatory.

|grails.plugin.auditLog.verbose
|`true`
|Column by column change logging in insert and delete events is enabled by default. You can disable it if you are not interested in value changes.

|grails.plugin.auditLog.logIds
|`false`
|If set to true, object-ids of associated objects are logged

|grails.plugin.auditLog.disabled
|false
|If set to true, audit logging is disabled, but the eventHandlers are still triggered. Note: You can set "auditLog.disabled" in  DataSource configurations you do not want to have the AuditLogListener registered in. This could be useful if you have multiple DataSource definitions, but want to audit only a few of them.

|grails.plugin.auditLog.nonVerboseDelete
|false
|Log deletes non-verbosely if verbose = true

|grails.plugin.auditLog.logFullClassName
|false
|Log the entity including the package name

|grails.plugin.auditLog.truncateLength
|255
|Configure the truncation length of newValue detail information. Must me <= field size of oldMap and newMap in your Auditing domain class. If you define the truncate length larger than your AuditTrail classes newValue maxSize constraint, the field size of newValue is used instead. If you do not define truncateLength, the written data in newValue is truncated at the field size boundary.

|grails.plugin.auditLog.stampEnabled
|false
|Add stamping fields to all auditable domain classes using AST transformation (dateCreated, lastUpdated, createdBy, lastUpdatedBy)

|grails.plugin.auditLog.stampAlways
|false
|always stamp Domain Classes regardless of @Stamp or "static stampable = true"

|grails.plugin.auditLog.stampCreatedBy
|createdBy
|Field name for stamping support

|grails.plugin.auditLog.stampLastUpdatedBy
|lastUpdatedBy
|Field name for lastUpdateBy field.

|actorClosure
|`null`
|Closure to get the principal. Details see below.

|====================

=== Auditing Current User Information (actorClosure)

With version >= 0.5, additional configuration can be specified in the application.groovy file of the project to help log the
authenticated user for various security systems.
For many security systems the defaults will work fine. To specify a property of the userPrincipal to be logged as the actor
name (the person performing the action which triggered the event, e.g. the username) add these lines to application.groovy:

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  plugin {
   auditLog {
     actorClosure = { request, session ->
      session.user?.username
     }
   }
  }
}

----

[WARNING]
====
It is currently not possible to define the actorClosure as a property like

[source,groovy]
----
grails.plugin.auditLog.actorClosure = {...}
----

====

==== Spring Security Core Plugin 1.1.2 or higher

If you save data from an unprotected URL (configAttribute:IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY), the principal is a String-object
not a Principal-object. To cope with this behaviour you should use the following Closure definition in application.groovy:

[source,groovy]
----
import org.codehaus.groovy.grails.plugin.springsecurity.SpringSecurityUtils
----

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  plugin {
     auditLog {
        actorClosure = { request, session ->
          if (request.applicationContext.springSecurityService.principal instanceof groovy.lang.String){
           return request.applicationContext.springSecurityService.principal
          }
          def username = request.applicationContext.springSecurityService.principal?.username
          if (SpringSecurityUtils.isSwitched()){
           username = SpringSecurityUtils.switchedUserOriginalUsername+" AS "+username
          }
          return username
        }
     }
  }
}
----

==== Spring Security Core 1.0.1 Plugin

Based off of Jorge Aguilera's example, the Spring Security Plugin uses the SpringSecurityService.
[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  plugin {
    auditLog {
      actorClosure = { request, session ->
       request.applicationContext.springSecurityService.principal?.username
      }
    }
  }
}
----

==== Acegi Plugin

Thanks to Jorge Aguilera for his example on how to integrate with the Acegi plugin:

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  plugin {
    auditLog {
      actorClosure = { request, session ->
       return request.applicationContext.authenticateService.principal()?.username
      }
    }
  }
}
----

==== CAS Authentication

For example if you are using a system such as CAS you can specify the CAS user attribute using a special configuration
property to get the CAS user name. In application.groovy  add the following lines:

[source,groovy]
----
import edu.yale.its.tp.cas.client.filter.CASFilter
----

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  plugin {
    auditLog {
     actorClosure = { request, session ->
       session?.getAttribute(CASFilter.CAS_FILTER_USER)
     }
    }
  }
}
----

â€¦ and the audit_log table will have a record of which user and what controller triggered the event.

==== Shiro Plugin

With Shiro, add the following lines to use the currently logged in user's username:

[source,groovy]
----
grails {
  plugin {
    auditLog {
     actorClosure = { request, session ->
       org.apache.shiro.SecurityUtils.getSubject()?.getPrincipal()
     }
    }
  }
}
----

==== Other security systems

If you are using a custom authentication system in your controller that puts the user data into the session you can set
up the actorClosure to work with your security system instead.

=== Property Ignore List

It's possible to configure which properties get ignored by auditing. The default ignore field list is:
[source,groovy]
----
['version','lastUpdated'].
----

If you want to provide your own ignore list specify the ignore list like this in domain classes:

[source,groovy]
----
static auditable = [ignore:['version','lastUpdated','myField']]
----

If instead you want to trigger on version and lastUpdated changes you may specify an empty ignore list:

[source,groovy]
----
static auditable = [ignore:[]]
----

===  Whitelist properties to audit (since 2.0.6)
Since version 2.0.6, instead of blacklisting which properties to ignore, you can also define a list of properties to audit (whitelist) per Domain class.
The 'auditableProperties' setting has precedence over 'ignore'. Thanks to Paul Taylor for this feature.

[source,groovy]
----
static auditable = [auditableProperties: ['name', 'famous', 'lastUpdated']]
----

=== Verbose mode

You can enable verbose mode. If enabled, column by column change logging in insert and delete events is enabled.
Old- and new values are stored in detailed to the audit logging table. Enable verbose logging with:

[source,groovy]
----

 verbose = true

----

This setting is enabled by default.

[WARNING]
====
When enabling verbose audit logging, you may get errors if you explicitly flush the session. In this case, do not enable
verbose logging. Starting with version 1.0.1 of the plugin, additional closures are available to disable logging or
verbose mode in a code block.
====

=== Logging of associated objectIds (since 0.5.5)

You can log the object-ids of associated objects. Logging will be performed in the format: "[id:<objId>]objDetails".
You can enable id-logging with

[source,groovy]
----

 logIds = true

----

This setting is disabled by default.

=== Property value masking (since 0.5.5)

You can configure properties to mask on a per-Domain-Class base. If properties are defined as masked, their values are
not stored into the audit log table if verbose mode is enabled. Instead, a mask of "**********" will be logged.
By default, "password" properties are masked. You can mask property fields in domain classes like this:

[source,groovy]
----
static auditable = [mask:'password','otherField']
----


=== Verbose log truncation length

If you enabled verbose mode, you can configure the truncation length of detail information in the oldValue and newValue
columns (Default is 255). Configure the truncateLength in application.groovy:

[source,groovy]
----

 truncateLength = 400 // don't forget to ensure "oldValue" and "newValue" fields are large enough!

----

[WARNING]
====
When you set truncateLength to a value > 255 you must ensure that oldValue and newValue fields in your audit-log domain class
are large enough. Example setting with the same maxSize constraints as the former "largeValueColumnTypes" setting:

[source,groovy]
----
static constraints = {
  // for large column support (as in < 1.0.6 plugin versions)
  oldValue(nullable: true, maxSize: 65534)
  newValue(nullable: true, maxSize: 65534)
}
----

When you forgot to set the constraints in your AuditLog class while setting truncateLength > 255,
a truncation warning may occur and only partial information is logged.
====


=== Transactional AuditLog events

In application.groovy, you may specify whether the Audit Log uses transactions or not. If set to true then the logger will begin
and commit transactions around audit log save events.
If set to false (the default), the AuditLog may be persisted without a transaction wrapping its call to save.
This setting should not be changed from defaults lightly as it can cause problems in integration testing.

[source,groovy]
----

 transactional = true

----

You are only likely to want to change the defaults if you are working with a transactional database in test and production.


=== Disable auditing by config (since 0.5.5.3)

You can disable auditing by config. If you disable auditing, event handlers are still triggered but no changes are comitted
to the audit log table. This can be used e.g. if you need to bootstrap many objects and want to programmatically disable
auditing to not slow down the bootstrap process or if you want to audit log by Enviroment. With version >= 1.0.0 of the
plugin, you can disable auditing on a per-datasource base as well Currently, disabling the plugin on a per-datasource base
does not work. See GPAUDITLOGGING-68

[source,groovy]
----

 disabled = true

----

Disabling in DataSource.groovy is currently not possible.

This setting is "false" by default (auditing is enabled).

=== nonVerboseDelete logging (since 1.0.1)

If verbose logging is enabled (see above), you can log deletes in a non-verbose manner. This means, only the delete event
is logged, but not the properties the deleted object hold prior the deletion.

[source,groovy]
----

 nonVerboseDelete = true

----

This setting is "false" by default (verbosity of deletes depend on the verbose setting).

=== log full domain class name (since 1.0.3)

By default, only the entity class name is logged. If you want to log the entity full name (including the package name),
you can enable full logging. Thanks to tcrossland for this feature.

[source,groovy]
----

 logFullClassName = true

----

This setting is "false" by default (entity name is logged).

=== getAuditLogUri closure (since 1.0.4)

By default, the "uri" field is filled with the request uri which caused the action.
You can define a closure "getAuditLogUri" on a per-domain object base to define what should be written to the AuditLog
"uri" field.

[source,groovy]
----
class User {
  static auditable = true
  static belongsTo = [Client]

  def getAuditLogUri = {
    clientId as String
  }
}
----

You need to take special care how you obtain the "uri" data in the getAuditLogUri closure.
It is recommended to not perform costly calls.

=== Domain class stamping support (since 1.0.4)

Since version 1.0.4, it is possible to enable domain class stamping support.
With this feature enabled, all domain classes annotated with @Stamp or with field "static stampable = true" will get
the fields dateCreated, lastUpdated, createdBy, lastUpdatedBy using an AST transformation.
You can create your own StampASTTransformation implementation for your specific needs.
The createdBy and lastUpdatedBy fieldnames can be declared in application.groovy.
These fields will be filled with the result of the actor closure on the event PreInsert, PreUpdate and PreDelete.
Thanks to tkvw for this feature.

[source,groovy]
----
stampEnabled = true // enable stamping support
stampAlways = false // always stamp domain classes, regardless of @Stamp or static stampable = true existence
stampCreatedBy = 'createdBy' // fieldname
stampLastUpdatedBy = 'lastUpdatedBy' // fieldname
----

=== Domain class stamping configuration (since 2.0.5)

Since version 2.0.5, it is possible to specify the field configuration on a per domain-class base in the @Stamp annotation.
With this, you can specify the createdBy, lastUpdatedBy, dateCreated, lastUpdated fieldnames per domain class.

Adding @Stamp to the entity disables the default Grails autoStamping by adding "autoTimestamp false" to the mapping (this can't be configured).

Example:
[source,groovy]
----
 @Stamp(
     createdBy = @StampInfo(fieldname="originalWho", type=Date.class),
     dateCreated = @StampInfo(fieldname="originalWhen", type=Date.class),
     lastUpdatedBy = @StampInfo(fieldname="lastWho", nullable = true),
     lastUpdated = @StampInfo(fieldname="lastWhen", nullable = true)
     )
----

=== Ignoring certain events (since 1.0.5 / 2.0.0)

Since version 1.0.5, it is possible to ignore certain events on a per-domain base.

[source,groovy]
----
static auditable = [ignoreEvents:["onChange","onSave"]]
----

=== Domain Name replacements (since 2.0.1) ===
With the replacementPatterns Map, it is possible to rewrite domain names, e.g. to remove dedicated package names:

[source,groovy]
----
replacementPatterns = ["local.example.xyz.User":"UserDomain"]
----

=== Example configuration

Example application.groovy configuration with various settings as described above:

[source,groovy]
----
// AuditLog Plugin config
grails {
  plugin {
    auditLog {
     auditDomainClassName = 'my.example.project.MyAuditTrail'
     verbose = true // verbosely log all changed values to db
     logIds = true  // log db-ids of associated objects.
     truncateLength = 1000
     cacheDisabled = true  // only for 1.x. Disable caching of AuditDomainClass.
     replacementPatterns = ["local.example.xyz.":""] // replace with empty string.
     actorClosure = { request, session ->
        // SpringSecurity Core 1.1.2
        if (request.applicationContext.springSecurityService.principal instanceof groovy.lang.String){
           return request.applicationContext.springSecurityService.principal
        }
        def username = request.applicationContext.springSecurityService.principal?.username
        if (SpringSecurityUtils.isSwitched()){
           username = SpringSecurityUtils.switchedUserOriginalUsername+" AS "+username
        }
        return username
     }
     stampEnabled = true
     stampAlways = true
    }
  }
}
